# Crime NER Fine-Tuning Project: Complete Training Guide

## 📋 Project Overview

This project fine-tunes **Meta-Llama-3-8B-Chat** to extract Named Entities (NER) from crime reports. The model learns to identify and extract specific information like officer names, crime types, evidence, victims, witnesses, and suspects from unstructured crime report text in JSON format.

**Project Goal**: Convert a general-purpose LLM into a specialized information extraction tool for law enforcement data.

---

## 🎯 What is Happening (High-Level)

1. **Base Model**: Llama 3 8B (a general-purpose conversational AI)
2. **Fine-Tuning Goal**: Make it extract crime-related entities in JSON format
3. **Method**: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) - memory-efficient parameter tuning
4. **Dataset**: 250 crime reports with multi-turn question-answering conversations
5. **Result**: A specialized model that understands crime reports and returns structured data

---

## 📊 Data Structure

### Dataset Format: JSONL (JSON Lines)

Each line is a complete training example with this structure:

```json
{
  "conversation": "System_Prompt\nUser: Text:\n[CRIME_REPORT_TEXT]\nAssistant: I've read this text.\nUser: What describes [ENTITY_TYPE] in the text?\nAssistant: {\"[ENTITY_TYPE]\": [VALUES]}\n... (repeats for ~18 entity types)"
}
```

### Input to Model: Crime Report Text

```
**Crime Type:** Theft  
**Date and Time:** September 30, 2025, at 14:30  
**Location:** 456 Oak Street, Springfield  
**Reporting Officer:** Officer John Smith, Badge #1457  
**Summary:** A theft occurred at the Oak Street Boutique, with several high-end clothing items reported missing.  
**Description of Victim(s):** Oak Street Boutique, owned by Mary Thompson, age 35.  
**Evidence Collected:** Security footage, clothing tags, and a shopping bag.  
[... more details ...]
```

### Expected Outputs: JSON with 18 Entity Types

```json
{
  "Location": ["456 Oak Street, Springfield"],
  "Officer_BadgeNumber": ["1457"],
  "Officer_Name": ["Officer John Smith"],
  "Victim_Name": ["Oak Street Boutique"],
  "Victim_Age": [35],
  "Victim_Owner": ["Mary Thompson"],
  "Crime_Type": ["Theft"],
  "Crime_Date": ["September 30, 2025"],
  "Crime_Time": ["14:30"],
  "Crime_Summary": ["A theft occurred at the Oak Street Boutique..."],
  "Crime_Status": ["Under Investigation"],
  "Evidence_Type": ["Security footage", "clothing tags", "shopping bag"],
  "Witness_Name": [],
  "Suspect_Description": ["Not provided"],
  "Victim_Age": [],
  "Victim_Manager": [],
  "Victim_CEO": [],
  "Victim_Email": []
}
```

## 🔄 Training Data Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Loading
- **Source**: `/kaggle/input/dataset/dataset.jsonl` (250 examples)
- **Format**: JSONL with conversation strings
- **Size**: 225 training samples + 25 test samples (90/10 split)

### Step 2: Parsing Conversations
The `format_chat_template()` function converts flat conversation strings into structured messages:

**Before (Raw String)**:
```
A virtual assistant answers questions from a user based on the provided text.
User: Text: [crime report]
Assistant: I've read this text.
User: What describes Officer_Name in the text?
Assistant: {"Officer_Name": ["Officer John Smith"]}
```

**After (Structured Messages)**:
```python
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "A virtual assistant..."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Text: [crime report]"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've read this text."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What describes Officer_Name...?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"Officer_Name\": [...]}"}
]
```

### Step 3: Chat Template Formatting (Llama 3 Format)
Applied using tokenizer with special tokens:

```
<|begin_of_text|>
<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
A virtual assistant answers questions from a user based on the provided text.
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Text: [crime report details]
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
I've read this text.
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What describes Officer_Name in the text?
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
{"Officer_Name": ["Officer John Smith"]}
<|eot_id|>
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture & Training Setup

### Model Configuration

| Component | Setting | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Base Model** | Llama 3 8B Chat | State-of-the-art instruction-following model |
| **Quantization** | 4-bit (NF4) | Reduce 16GB → 4GB VRAM; no accuracy loss |
| **Dtype** | FP16 | Faster computation on GPU |
| **Attention** | Eager | Compatible with all hardware |

### QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)

Instead of fine-tuning all 8 billion parameters, QLoRA:
- Keeps the 4-bit quantized model frozen
- Adds small trainable "adapter" matrices to key layers
- **Only 0.1% of parameters trainable** (~8M out of 8B)
- Achieves similar results to full fine-tuning with 90% less VRAM

**LoRA Configuration**:
```python
r = 16                    # Rank of adaptation (lower = fewer params)
lora_alpha = 32           # Scaling (2x rank is standard)
lora_dropout = 0.05       # Regularization
target_modules = [        # Where to insert adapters:
  'up_proj',              # Feed-forward up projection
  'down_proj',            # Feed-forward down projection
  'gate_proj',            # Gate projection (GLU)
  'k_proj',               # Key projection (attention)
  'q_proj',               # Query projection (attention)
  'v_proj',               # Value projection (attention)
  'o_proj'                # Output projection (attention)
]
```

## 🔍 How Input → Output Works

### Complete Training Example (One Step)

**Input (Tokenized)**:
```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
A virtual assistant answers questions from a user based on the provided text.
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Text: **Crime Type:** Theft | **Location:** 456 Oak Street | **Officer:** John Smith, Badge #1457 | ...
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
I've read this text.
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What describes Officer_BadgeNumber in the text?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
{"Officer_BadgeNumber": ["1457"]}
<|eot_id|>
```

**What Happens Inside**:
1. Tokens flow through model layers
2. Each token attends to previous tokens via attention
3. LoRA adapters apply learned transformations
4. Output layer predicts next token probability
5. Loss = cross-entropy between predicted and actual next token

**Loss Calculation** (per token):
```
Loss = -log(P(actual_token | previous_tokens))

Example:
- Predicted: P("1") = 0.95  → Loss = -log(0.95) ≈ 0.05 (good!)
- Predicted: P("1") = 0.10  → Loss = -log(0.10) ≈ 2.30 (bad!)
```

**Backward Pass**:
- Gradients flow backwards through layers
- Only LoRA weights get updated (frozen base model)
- Update: `new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate × gradient`

---

## 🧠 What the Model Learns

### Before Fine-Tuning
```
Q: "What describes Officer_Name in 'Officer John Smith reported the crime'?"
A: [Generic response, not structured, may hallucinate]
```

### After Fine-Tuning
```
Q: "What describes Officer_Name in 'Officer John Smith reported the crime'?"
A: {"Officer_Name": ["Officer John Smith"]}
```

**Key Learnings**:
1. Identify entity types from questions
2. Extract relevant text from crime reports
3. Format answers as JSON with key: [values] structure
4. Handle edge cases (empty values → [])
5. Preserve exact text from reports (no paraphrasing)

---

## 📈 Validation & Testing

### Test Set Evaluation
- **Size**: 25 samples (10% of dataset)
- **Method**: Never seen during training
- **Evaluation**: Token-level accuracy on assistant responses

### Post-Training Inference Test
```python
# New unseen crime report (not in training)
Input Crime Report (Vandalism):
  Location: Springfield Public Library
  Crime Type: Vandalism
  Officer: Detective Emily Reed
  Evidence: Rocks, glass fragments, security footage

Question: "What describes Evidence_Type in the text?"

Expected Output: {"Evidence_Type": ["Rocks", "glass fragments", "security footage"]}
```

⚠️ **Known Issue**: The current output shows garbled JSON, suggesting:
- Model needs more epochs
- Inference generation parameters need tuning
- Possible memory/context window issue

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- Train model to mimic desired behavior (extract entities in JSON)
- Each input-output pair is a supervised example
- Loss = how wrong the model's outputs are
- Goal: Minimize loss over all examples

### Multi-Turn Conversations
- Model sees multiple Q&A exchanges in one example
- Learns to maintain context across turns
- Assistants responses are what's optimized

### Token vs. Sequence Loss
- **Token Loss**: Average loss per token (easier to compare across examples)
- **Sequence Loss**: Loss for entire output (sensitive to sequence length)
- Used: Token-level loss

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Perplexity**: e^(avg_loss) - lower is better
- **Token Accuracy**: % of tokens that match ground truth
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: Text similarity (less applicable for JSON)
